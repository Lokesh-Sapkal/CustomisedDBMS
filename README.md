# CustomisedDBMS
A Customised DBMS implemented in Java with serialization support.

# Customised Employee Database Management System (DBMS)

A simple console-based Employee Database Management System built in Java.  
The project demonstrates the basic design of a DBMS-like application using *object-oriented principles* and a clean *modular structure*.
