# CustomisedDBMS

A Java-based console application simulating a simple Database Management System (DBMS) using LinkedList as the storage.  
Supports employee record management,  Backup & Restore, and selective SELECT queries.

---

## Overview

CustomisedDBMS allows users to manage Employee records with the ability to:  
- Insert new employee records  
- Display all or specific fields using SELECT queries  
- Backup current database state to a file
- Restore database from a previous backup    

It is fully console-driven, using a parser-like command interface.
