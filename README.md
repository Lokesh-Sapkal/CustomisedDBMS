# Customised DBMS Application

A command-line interface (CLI) based database management system designed for managing employee records.   
This application allows users to perform CRUD operations, backup and restore data and interact with the database through a simple text-based interface.

---

## Overview

CustomisedDBMS allows users to manage Employee records with the ability to:  
- Insert new employee records  
- Display all or specific fields using SELECT queries  
- Backup current database state to a file
- Restore database from a previous backup    

It is fully console-driven, using a parser-like command interface.
